With the consensus aiming towards an educated public on digital privacy, it’s
no surprise to see an increasing interest in encryption algorithms. MD5
algorithm was one of the first hashing algorithms to take the global stage as a
successor to the MD4 algorithm. Despite the security vulnerabilities
encountered in the future, MD5 remains a crucial part of data infrastructure in a
multitude of environments.
MD5 is a cryptographic hash function algorithm developed in 1991 by Ronald
Rivest that takes the message as input of any length and changes it into a fixed-
length message of 16 bytes.
MD5 algorithm stands for the message-digest algorithm and it’s output is
always in 128 bits
MD5 message-digest algorithm is the 5th version of the Message-Digest
Algorithm developed by Ronald Rivest to produce a 128-bit message digest.
MD5 is quite fast than other versions of the message digest, which takes the
plain text of 512-bit blocks, which is further divided into 16 blocks, each of 32
bit and produces the 128-bit message digest, which is a set of four blocks, each
of 32 bits. MD5 produces the message digest through five steps, i.e. padding,
append length, dividing the input into 512-bit blocks, initializing chaining
variables a process blocks and 4 rounds, and using different constant it in each
iteration.
